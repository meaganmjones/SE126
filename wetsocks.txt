In the event of my untimely death, probably in a large explosion or mob shootout, I leave some of my belongings to people I pretend to get along with. 
	To Matt: I leave my 5 dollar pair of amazing headphones to be worn and used for years to come. I leave all of my flex dollars so he can live on my legacy of buying tater tots every morning. And also my sick fucking lizard. And also the best booger picking tool in the galaxy.
	To Marty: I leave all of my python codes for use in future examples of what not to do. 
	To Damian: I leave all of my drugs and monetary assets 
	To my dad: I leave my dog. Please Keep him safe. 
	To Megan: I leave my snacks, clothes, and other various useless belongings that nobody else would like to take. 
	To Sal: I leave my shiny white ass for him to kiss. 
	To my mom: I leave a singular loaded baked potato
	To my brother: I leave my socks, just the dirty single ones though. I leave a 25 dollar subway giftcard with a balance of 7.83
	To my brother's girlfriend: I leave the biggest bottle of Jack Daniels this world has ever seen.    
	To Dom: I leave my car with the seats and engine removed.
	To Nate: I leave my car engine and seats.
